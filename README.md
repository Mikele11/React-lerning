### Definitions

#### 25.09.2018 — react-complete-guide

<a name="functional"></a>Functional Component - This component is written in the form of a function in which only render. In functional components, you can not use a state

<a name="props"></a>Props - props it is short from the property. Each component has its own properties and we can transfer data to these properties for each component and read this data in the component using **this.props**

<a name="children"></a>Children - This is data within in the component. In React, a component can have one or more children. Since this.props.children can have one element, several elements or nothing at all, its value is, respectively, one child node, an array of child nodes, or undefined

<a name="state"></a>State - The state is used to support and modify data in the component. The component that manipulates the data gets it from outside and when they are made with actions inside the component, they are written into the state and then manipulated by them. You can access the state through **this.state**. You can also make changes to the state by using **setState**, When using which redraws DOM

<a name="setState"></a>setState - This is a function for changing a state that redraws changes to DOM

<a name="inline"></a>Inline style - This is a description of the styles inside the component

<a name="conditional"></a>Conditional render - conditional rendering in the react works like you do in javascript. Here you need the boolean values and unary operator **?**
