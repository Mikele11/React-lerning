<a name="functional"></a>Functional Component - This component is written in the form of a function in which only render. In functional components, you can not use a state

<a name="props"></a>Props - props it is short from the property. Each component has its own properties and we can transfer data to these properties for each component and read this data in the component using **this.props**
